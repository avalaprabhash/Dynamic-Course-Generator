Building on your setup, this lesson dives into Python's syntax rules, like how spaces (indentation) act as invisible fences for code groups. This matters because Python enforces readability; messy code simply won't run, training you to write professional code from day one.\n\nImagine recipes where ingredients are bulleted perfectly \u2013 Python's rules make your programs that organized. Mastering this unlocks writing multi-line code confidently, without syntax errors frustrating you.",

You can put multiple on one line with ';', but don't \u2013 readability first.[5]\n\nWhy? English sentences end with periods; Python uses line breaks for clarity. No need to count braces. This simplicity speeds learning.\n\nAnalogy: Like writing a shopping list \u2013 each item on its line, no extra symbols cluttering.",
