If you've never coded before, don't worry \u2013 we're starting from square one, just like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. Python is special because it's designed to be readable and straightforward, almost like writing English sentences. In this lesson, we'll get Python onto your computer and run your first program. This matters because without a working setup, you can't practice, and practice is how you build confidence in programming.\n\nThink of installation as setting up your kitchen before cooking: you need the right tools (oven, pots) before making your first meal. By the end of this lesson, you'll have Python running and see your own code come to life on screen, which is one of the most exciting 'aha!' moments in programming.",

                "title": "What is Python and Why Use It?",
                "explanation": "Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It's like a versatile toolbox that lets you automate tasks, build websites, analyze data, and more. Unlike complex languages with curly braces and semicolons everywhere, Python uses simple indentation (spaces at the start of lines) to organize code, making it easier to read. Imagine trying to follow a recipe written in legalese versus plain English \u2013 Python is the plain English version.\n\nThe 'why' is simple: Python runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even tiny devices like Raspberry Pi. It's interpreted, meaning you write code and it runs immediately without compiling first, perfect for quick experiments. Key fact to remember: always use Python 3 (not the outdated Python 2). This lesson focuses on remembering these basics so you can spot them in tutorials later.\n\nHow it works: Python has an interpreter that reads your code line by line and executes instructions. This is why it's great for beginners \u2013 immediate feedback helps you learn faster.",
                "code_example": "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n# This is your first Python program!"

              {
                "title": "The Python REPL: Your Interactive Playground",
                "explanation": "REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. It's Python's interactive shell where you type commands and see results instantly, like a conversation with your computer. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux), type 'python' or 'python3', and you're in! Type 'print(\"Hi\")' and press Enter \u2013 boom, 'Hi' appears. Exit with 'exit()' or Ctrl+D.\n\nWhy remember this? The REPL is for testing ideas quickly, like sketching on paper before painting a full picture. It's how pros experiment without creating files. To verify installation, type 'python --version' in terminal; it should show something like 'Python 3.12.0'. If not, we'll fix it in the walkthrough.\n\nConnection to prior concept: The REPL uses the same interpreter as full programs, so skills transfer directly.",

              "Step 1: Download Python from python.org/downloads. Choose the latest Python 3 version for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux). Why? Official site ensures safety and compatibility. Run the installer, check 'Add Python to PATH' on Windows.",
              "Step 2: Verify installation. Open terminal/Command Prompt, type 'python --version' or 'python3 --version'. See version number? Great! This confirms the interpreter is ready. Connection: PATH lets your system find Python anywhere.",
              "Step 3: Start REPL with 'python' or 'python3'. Type 'print(\"Hello from REPL!\")'. It prints immediately. Variation: Try '2 + 2' \u2013 outputs 4. Handles math too!",
              "Step 4: Create first script. Open Notepad/TextEdit, write 'print(\"Hello, World!\")', save as 'hello.py'. In terminal, navigate to folder (cd path), run 'python hello.py'. Everything together: file-based execution.",
              "Step 5: Watch for 'command not found' (fix PATH), or 'No module named...' (reinstall). Verify: run script twice, check output matches. Success!"

Like a recipe saying 'if oven hot, bake', programs check conditions. Why? Real apps react: 'if age >=18, allow entry'. Builds on types: now manipulate and decide.\n\nThis shifts to applying knowledge: write code that computes and chooses. Encouraging: small steps yield powerful results!",
